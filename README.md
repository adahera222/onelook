One Look
========

Simple puzzle game for Ludum Dare 28 Jam.

You wake up to find yourself alone in a dark world. Try to make your way out with only one look at your disposal. Avoid the monsters and obstacles in your way as you search for a way out of this creepy realm, relying on more than just your eyes. 

WASD or arrows to move, number keys for items. M to mute music. SPACE to pause. Use headphones, as stereo sound implemented. Google Chrome recommended.
